# 🍔 Swiggy Live Clone – Real-time Food Delivery UI

🚨 LIVE DATA POWERED BY: **Official Swiggy API**

This is a **Swiggy Clone** built with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Redux**, showcasing real-world API integration using the **official production Swiggy API**.
Unlike many clones that use static or mock data, this app fetches **live restaurant and menu data** from Swiggy’s backend — the exact same API their real app uses.

> ⚠️ **Important:** To use this app, you **must enable a CORS extension** (like [ALLOW CORS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en)) in your browser. Without it, API requests will fail due to CORS restrictions.

## 🔐 About the API & CORS Handling

Swiggy’s API is not public and is protected with **CORS headers**, which block frontend requests from other domains.

To work around this:

1. This project **uses the real production Swiggy API**.
2. You must install and enable a CORS extension (like **ALLOW CORS**).
3. This extension strips/block headers like `Origin`, allowing browser access.

> ✅ This setup mimics real-world scenarios where developers test internal/protected APIs in frontend apps.
